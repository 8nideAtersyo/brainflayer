## What is a Talaqnama Form?
 
A talaqnama form is a legal document that records the divorce of a Muslim couple in Pakistan. It is based on the Islamic law of talaq, which allows a husband to divorce his wife by pronouncing the word "talaq" three times in front of two witnesses. The wife can also initiate the divorce by asking the husband to grant her talaq or by seeking a judicial decree of khula.
 
A talaqnama form contains the following information:

- The name, address, and identity card number of the husband.

- The signatures of the husband, wife, and two witnesses.
- The stamp and seal of the registrar or court that issued the talaqnama form.

A talaqnama form is a valid proof of divorce in Pakistan and can be used for various purposes, such as remarriage, inheritance, property division, etc. It can also be challenged or appealed in court if there are any disputes or irregularities.
